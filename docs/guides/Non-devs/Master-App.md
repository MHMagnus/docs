## Master app

The **Master app** function of NStack can be used in the situation of white labelling applications. 

It allows the creation of one master app and several children apps that inherit sections / keys/ apps from the master app. A good example would be the creation of a "template" / generic festival app; the children apps can be considered partical festivals (e.g. one app for the Roskilde Festival, one app for the Uh√∏rt festival, one app for Tommorowland, etc.). 

As stated above, the children apps will inherit sections / keys / apps from the "template" festival app (e.g. error messages, login screens), but certain sections / keys / apps can be modified to be unique to the specific festival (splash screen title, etc.).

The **Master app** function is accesable from NStack app's main screen.

From the new screen that is dispalyed on screen, in the upper-right corner the option for **Sync - Master app** appears.
