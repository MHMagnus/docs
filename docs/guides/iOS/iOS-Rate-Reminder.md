## Rate Reminder on iOS

Rate reminder shows the user Apple's build in rate reminder after the user has launched the app a certain amount of times.

You don't have to do anything to use the rate reminder feature, just include the NStack sdk in your project. See [**iOS - Installation**](../../guides/iOS/iOS.html) on how to install NStack for iOS.

To enable the rate reminder configure it on the NStack web console. See [**Getting Started**](../../guides/Non-devs/getting-started.html) on how to create a new application on the NStack web console.

> **NOTE:** This feature is not yet supported on macOS and watchOS.
