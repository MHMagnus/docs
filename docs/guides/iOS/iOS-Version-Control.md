## Version control on iOS

Version control informs the user when a new version is available and what new changes are available.
You don't have to do anything to use the version control feature, just include the NStack sdk in your project. 
See [**iOS - Installation**](../../guides/iOS/iOS.html) on how to install NStack for iOS.

To enable version control, create a new application on the NStack web console. See [**Getting Started**](../../guides/Non-devs/getting-started.html) on how to create a new application on the NStack web console.

> **NOTE:** This feature is not yet supported on macOS and watchOS.
