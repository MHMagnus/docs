## Messages on iOS

Messages shows the user a custom message when the app is launched, for example warning them about a server outage.

You don't have to do anything to use the messages feature, just include the NStack sdk in your project. See [**iOS - Installation**](../../guides/iOS/iOS.html) on how to install NStack for iOS.

To show the users a message,  create a new message on the NStack web console. 
See [**Getting Started**](../../guides/Non-devs/getting-started.html) on how to create a new application on the NStack web console.


> **NOTE:** This feature is not yet supported on macOS and watchOS.
