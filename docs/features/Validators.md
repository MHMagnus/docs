# Validators

#### Phone number

The phone number validator **validates** if a given phone number has the **right amount of digits** according to the **origin countries** standard.

#### Email

The email validator is not only a **validator** for the **structure** of the email address, but also checks for **common mistakes** (e.g.: typing .con instead .com) and can return a warning if there seems to be a common mistake.
