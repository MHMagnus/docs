# Localize

Localize is the most used feature of NStack and can/**should** be used **in all apps**.  
Localize is a way to **manage** all the **text** on all the platforms, it manages **translations** and allows you to **update text** in apps **without** having to **release** a **new version**.  
This way the PM or the client can change any text in the project straight from the NStack website.

**Use cases:**

- Button titles
- Screen titles
- Base urls (Useful when the backend is not stable yet or the app is working with a beta api for the time being)
- URLs for terms of service
