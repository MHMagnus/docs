# Terms

*Terms* let's you create versioned content like "Terms & Conditions", "Privacy policies", "Cookie policies" etc
    - Version them as they get updated by providing a version name and number
    - Localize them for every language you need to support
    - NStack will store which users have seen which versions (compliance requirement for some products)
    - NStack will serve the newest, non seen version (based on GUID) in the best fit language (just as Localize)
 
 You can find examples on how to implement **Terms** for the following platforms:
 
 * [Android](../../docs/guides/Android/android-terms.html)
 
There are also APIs to use each of the feature one by one. App Open response will provide new versions of terms which haven't been seen yet.
