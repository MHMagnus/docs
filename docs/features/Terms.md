# Terms

Here you can create "Terms & Conditions", "Privacy policies", "Cookie policies" etc
    - Version them as they get updated
    - Localize them
    - NStack will store which user have seen which version (compliance requirement for some products)
    - NStack will serve the newest, non seen version in the best fit language (just as localize)

You can find examples on how to implement **Terms** for the following platforms:

- [Android](../../docs/guides/Android/android-terms.html)

There is APIs to use each of the feature one by one, but also in app open is there a new array with new versions of terms which haven't been seen yet.
