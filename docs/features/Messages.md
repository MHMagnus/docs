# Messages

Using the Messages feature, it can be a great tool for **informing your user** about technical difficulties, new sales or actions, etc.
This message is shown to the user **on app launch**.
You can configure how often the user will see the message, currently 2 options are available:

- "Show always" - Shows the message on **every** app launch

- "Show once" - Shows the message **once** on app launch and will not be shown again after the user presses "OK".  

Optionally you can define a URL which will add a dedicated button to the message dialog.

You can find examples on how to implement **Messages** for the following platforms:

- [iOS](../../docs/guides/iOS/ios-messages.html)
- [Android](../../docs/guides/Android/android-messages.html)

## Set up

**Messages** can be access from the *Notify* section, of the NStack web console. In the beginning, it gives an overview of current messages based on the desired platform.

To create a **Message**, the **Create** button is located in the upper right corner of the page. When creating a message, you can specify the platform and how often to show message, together with the content of the message.
