# Files

The files feature allows you to **store** all kinds of **files** (images, pdf's, ...) that can then be easily retrieved by anyone with the proper access.  
This can be very useful to host **static images** like backgrounds or header images.
The files are accessible through an **URL** so this can be used on **any platform**.

**Access settings:**

- Private options:
  - "Password protected" - Requires a **password** to view the file.
  - "Login protected" - Requires the user to **login** and have **access** to the application to view the file.
- Public options:
  - "CDN" - The file is cached and can be **loaded faster** with options (width, height). But the file **cannot be deleted fast**.
  - "Web server" - The file is served via web server, it is **slower** that CDN but can be **deleted fast**.

**Use cases:**

- Background image
- Header image
- PDF file with terms of service

You can find examples on how to implement **Files** for the following platforms:
