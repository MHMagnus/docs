# Collections

The collections feature can be seen as a **more structured** version of the **responses** feature, and in turn it can be very **versatile** and a good **alternative** for **custom APIs** for simple apps/websites.

In the collections feature you can **define** a **template** (e.g.: A Product which has a title, description and price), using this model you can **add collections** and **single** Products to be stored.

An **example** could be:

You have defined you **"Product"** template, a product should have a **title**, **description** and **price**.  
Using this template you can setup certain **collections**:

- All products
- Available products
- Products on sale

But you can also define a **single** product based on the **template**, an example for that could be "Product of the day", "Most popular product", ...

A generic product is just **1 example** of what the collections could be used for and you can of course use **more templates** at the **same time**.  
On the **right project** with the **right planning** this feature can be very **powerful**. 

**Use cases:**

- Store a list of All product/articles
- Store a list of available products/ articles
- Feature the "Product of the day" 
- Store an apps default configuration along with some premade configurations 

You can find examples on how to implement **Collections** for the following platforms:

* [iOS](../../docs/guides/iOS/iOS-Collections.html)
* [Android](../../docs/guides/Android/Android-Collections.html)
