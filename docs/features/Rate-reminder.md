# Rate reminders

Rate reminders ask the user to **rate** the app on the platform specific **store**.  
You can currently only configure the rate reminder based on the amount of times the user has **opened** the **app**.
The popup is shown **on app launch** when the required amount of app openings has been met.

**iOS**

On iOS this is done by showing Apple's build in rating popup.  
*"You should be aware that the prompt will only be displayed to a user a maximum of **three** times within a **365-day period**."* - [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/requesting_app_store_reviews)
